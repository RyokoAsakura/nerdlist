# What's The Nerdlist?
We think we're so smart.

This is a list of passwords more likely to be used by sysadmins, general nerds, and folk with access. Apologies for the profanity; anecdotally these passwords are in use.

## Participate
- Add your nerdiest password to The Nerdlist! First time [contributors](contributing.md) to information security repos are incredibly welcome!Pun requests welcome!
**ADD YOUR NAME TO AUTHORS.TXT IF YOU CONTRIBUTE!!**
- Win a solid silver challenge coin made like the Scrabble tiles in Sneakers if you crack a password in the wild using this list. See [solutions/instructions.txt](solutions/instructions.txt) for more. Since we're giving away solid silver coins, we verify with a brief video call or an in-person demo or a trusted community member's word that you succeeded.
