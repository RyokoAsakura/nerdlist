# nerdlist
Project run by Ean Meyer, Tabatha DiDomenico, and Tarah Wheeler.

Created by @tarah for entertainment and research purposes.
This is a list of passwords more likely to be used by sysadmins,
general nerds, and folk with access. First time contributors to information security repos are incredibly welcome!! Email t@tarah.org if you want help or aren't sure if you should contribute (spoiler: you should!)

Win a solid silver challenge coin made like the Scrabble tiles in Sneakers if you crack a password in the wild using this list! See solutions/instructions.txt for more. Since we're giving away solid silver coins, we verify with a brief video call or an in-person demo or a trusted community member's word that you succeeded.

**ADD YOUR NAME TO AUTHORS.TXT IF YOU CONTRIBUTE!!**

We think we're so smart.
Pun requests welcome!
Apologies for the profanity; anecdotally these passwords are in use.
